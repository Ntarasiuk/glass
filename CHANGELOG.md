# Changelog

What changed in each release of Glass. `glass update` (or the Glass app) installs the newest; every build is on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ntarasiuk/glass/releases).

## 0.10.0

October 31, 2026

### AI agents read Mac apps as text

- `snapshot` reads a Mac app's window (and its menu bar) as text: each button, field, menu item and line of text, with a ref on everything an agent can act on.
- `press` clicks a button, link, checkbox, tab, menu item or row by ref, through Accessibility. Your pointer doesn't move, even for a window behind others.
- `set_value` fills in a text field by ref without typing, and reports what the field shows afterwards.
- A ref is good only while its window stays the same: if it changed or closed, the action is refused ("Nothing was done") instead of hitting whatever is there now. Replies say whether the action happened, didn't, or was sent but not confirmed.
- The same rules as clicks: an agent's app limits and protected apps apply. Password fields are never read, and agents from other devices can't fill them in.
- Works with native and Electron apps, and with Chrome while its window is visible.

### Lock screen

- Typing the password at the lock screen from a viewer unlocks the Mac. Before, macOS rejected it as incorrect without checking it.
- Keys pressed into a password field aren't shown to viewers or written to the log ("a key, into a password field"). On Linux, the same while the session is locked (logind, hyprlock, swaylock and others).
- Agents with a grant can't type into password fields; they ask you instead.

### Stay awake with the lid closed

- New setting: `glass config lid-awake on`, or **Settings › Stay awake with the lid closed**. A closed laptop stays awake while it's plugged in, so you can still reach and unlock it. On battery it sleeps as usual.
- macOS: asks for the admin password once, to install a rule that allows only `pmset -a disablesleep 0|1`.
- Linux: no password; Glass holds systemd-logind's lid-switch inhibitor.

### Docs

- New section: [A locked screen, or a closed lid](https://glassdesk.dev/docs#a-locked-screen-or-a-closed-lid), and a changelog (this page).

- Guides and comparisons: a redesigned, wider layout.

## 0.9.0

October 29, 2026
