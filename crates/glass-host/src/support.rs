//! Quick support (`glass support`): someone who needs help runs one command, reads a short
//! code to the person helping them, and that person connects from any browser. Nothing
//! stays once it stops.
//!
//! - Where Glass's background service is already running, the session goes through it: the
//!   helper's asking, one-time link is made on the service (a second host would fight it
//!   for the screen), and stopping revokes the code, the link and the passes it let in.
//!   The service also removes them if `glass support` dies without cleaning up.
//! - Otherwise it runs a host of its own in a temporary config (token, keys, settings,
//!   logs) that's deleted when it stops.
//! - That host is the ordinary one, started in the session's config dir with remote access
//!   on (WebRTC through the introducer, like `glass link --anywhere`) and asking before
//!   anyone connects. On macOS it runs as a short-lived launchd job, so macOS asks for
//!   Screen Recording and Accessibility for Glass itself, not for the Terminal it was typed
//!   in; the job is removed when the session ends.
//! - The code: the introducer (glassdesk.dev, or `GLASS_BASE`) keeps code → link for an
//!   hour, hashed and single-use; the helper types it at /help.
