//! Video flow control: while a viewer's link is still busy with the frames already sent,
//! don't capture and encode a new one. The change stays pending (the capture keeps the
//! newest picture) and the next frame carries it, so nothing is dropped and no keyframe
//! has to be waited for. Dropping frames that were already encoded, as the WebRTC bridge
//! did, broke the stream until a keyframe, and a keyframe is the biggest frame there is
//! on exactly the link that can't take it.
//!
//! Each send path (a WebTransport session, the WebRTC bridge) keeps a [`Link`] for its
//! viewer: the frames sent and when, and how many bytes have left its send buffer, so it
//! knows which frames have gone. It publishes whether that link is full; the encoders are
//! shared, so a display is held while any viewer it goes to is full. A viewer stuck for
//! seconds (a dead socket, a suspended tab) stops holding everyone else up.
//!
//! A viewer that acknowledges frames once drawn (KIND_FRAME_ACK) is tracked by those
//! instead: a frame is gone when the viewer has it on screen, so every queue on the way
//! counts (a relay's, the network's, a slow decoder), and how long acknowledgements take
//! feeds its bitrate (rate::AckRate).
//!
//! Adapted from voxl (MIT, github.com/tembo/voxl): `flow_ok` in its video.rs, and the
//! delay and delivery estimates in its hub.rs.
