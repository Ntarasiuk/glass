//! Remote access without Tailscale: a browser anywhere reaches this host over WebRTC — a
//! direct, end-to-end encrypted UDP connection (relayed by TURN only when a direct path is
//! impossible). glassdesk.dev only introduces the two sides; the host keeps one outgoing
//! WebSocket to it and opens no ports.
//!
//! The host has its own key pair. Links carry the public key, and the host signs every
//! answer it gives, so a browser knows it reached *this* host even if the introducer were
//! compromised (the signature covers both sides' DTLS fingerprints).
//!
//! Each WebRTC peer is bridged to the ordinary WebTransport server on a local address
//! (loopback, unless `--bind` doesn't include it), so sessions, sign-in and everything
//! else work exactly as on the tailnet:
//! - data channel "d" (unordered, no retransmits) ⇄ datagrams
//! - a channel per stream: "bi" ⇄ bidirectional stream, "uni" ⇄ unidirectional stream
//!   (the host opens "uni" channels for streams it starts). A text message "end" finishes
//!   the stream.
